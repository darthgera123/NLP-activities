# Tokenizer is basically breaking them into different ones
# Stemmer is basically a library that does intelligent parsing on words rooting out punctuations

text = "The solution proposed by Dijkstra was to include the third arrangement, also known as the “the interrupt”.  While thecomputer calculates at full speed, a piece of dedicated hardware monitors the outside world for completion signals from communication devices. When a completion is detected, the program under execution is interrupted after thecurrent instruction and in such a way such that it can be resumed at a later moment as if nothing happened, thus instantaneously freeing the central processor for a suddenly more urgent task."
